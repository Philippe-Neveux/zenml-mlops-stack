# ZenML MLOps Stack on Google Cloud

A complete production-ready MLOps infrastructure deployment using Terraform, ArgoCD, and Kubernetes on Google Cloud Platform. This repository provides automated infrastructure provisioning and GitOps-based application deployment for a comprehensive ZenML stack.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

![Architecture Overview](assets/zenml_mlops_stacks_architecture.png)

This stack deploys a complete MLOps environment with the following components:

### Infrastructure Components
- **GKE Autopilot Cluster**: Managed Kubernetes with automatic scaling and security
- **VPC Networking**: Custom network with proper subnet configuration for security
- **Cloud SQL MySQL**: Managed database for ZenML metadata storage with private networking
- **Google Cloud Storage**: Artifact storage for ML models and datasets
- **Artifact Registry**: Container image registry for custom Docker images
- **Security**: IAM roles, service accounts, KMS encryption, and network security rules

### Application Stack (GitOps with ArgoCD)
- **ArgoCD**: GitOps continuous deployment for Kubernetes applications
- **NGINX Ingress Controller**: Production-ready ingress with LoadBalancer and HTTPS
- **cert-manager**: Automatic Let's Encrypt TLS certificate management
- **External Secrets Operator**: Secure secret management from Google Secret Manager
- **ZenML Server**: ML pipeline orchestration and model registry
- **MLflow Server**: ML experiment tracking and model serving

### Security & Networking
- **Automatic HTTPS**: Let's Encrypt certificates via cert-manager
- **Private GKE nodes**: Nodes without public IPs for enhanced security
- **Private database**: Cloud SQL accessible only from VPC
- **Secret management**: Integration with Google Secret Manager
- **Network security**: Firewall rules and IAM policies
